A weblog engine focusing on data ownership and persistence.

Description
===========

"Nefelibata" is a portuguese word derived from "nephele" (cloud) and "batha" (where you can walk), meaning "one who walks on clouds". It tries to conciliate these two facts:

    1. For persistence, you want to self host your content, as static files.
    2. Social interactions happen on social media, on websites that you don't control and that change relatively quickly.

Nefelibata solves this by publishing your static content to social media websites, and collecting comments and storing them locally. This way, your content is self hosteed, and interactions are preserved beyond the lifetime of social media websites.
